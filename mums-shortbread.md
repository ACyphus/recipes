2. 150g caster sugar
3. 300g butter

### Directions

1. Rub the flour into slightly softened butter
2. Add the sugar and knead well into a smooth mix
3. Place in baking tray and smooth down
4. Pierce the surface of the mixture with a fork
5. Bake at 160c for 30 minutes, or until lightly golden 
6. Sprinkle some sugar over the shortbread just after baking

### Tips and Notes

1. Keeping the butter and mixture cool while you work them will help prevent the shortbread drying out while baking. The softer the butter is in the mixture, the more the butter will evaporate or melt out of the mixture during baking. 
  - If you are making the mixture by hand, your hands will add a lot of heat to the mix. Try to handle the mixture as little as possible, and use cold water to keep your hands cool.
  - If you are using a mixer, the mixture should be kept cooler while it's worked.
